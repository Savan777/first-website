                    choose between a wide variety of characters, each filling different roles, which you will combine to build powerful team compositions. In game, you will split up to battle in three separate lanes in order to destroy turrets and make
                    your way towards the enemy base. To help you, there are neutral buffs which your team can battle and take in order to help your team in various ways. Once your team has broken into the enemy base, the final objective is to destroy
                    the enemy nexus.

                    <b>"Concussive Blows,"</b> allows him to stun enemies that he or his allies consecutively attack. His first ability, <b>"Winter's Bite,"</b> fires a ball of ice that slows anyone it hits. His second ability, "Stand Behind Me," allows
                    him to jump towards an ally and grant them resistances briefly. His third ability is <b>"Unbreakable,"</b> which causes him to raise his door as a shield to block incoming attacks. His ultimate ability is <b>"Glacial Fissure,"</b>                    in which he slams his shield into the ground, creating a shockwave of ice which damages and knocks up enemies, leaving behind a slowing field as well.
